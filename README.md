I worked on energy profiling and analysis for scientific computing during my Google Summer of Code term. This project focuses on building tools to validate power measurements and understand system behavior through Prometheus metrics.

This repository serves as a final report summary of my GSoC work.

## Project Abstract

The Prometheus Energy Profiler provides a workflow to correlate power consumption with system telemetry from Prometheus monitoring systems. The project enables external validation of energy measurements and produces visualizations. The work includes pairwise correlation analysis across disk, memory, network and process metrics, with a focus on power delta analysis.
